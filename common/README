This directory contains a set of free TrueType fonts that you may wish
to use with the 'texslides' setup. I obtained them from a variety of
sources. Verdana, Trebuchet, Monotype, Comic, and Georgia are from
Microsoft. The others are available on several free TrueType web sites.
All of these fonts are freely redistributable to my knowledge; let me
know if you think they are not.

You can download the file fonts.zip if you want them all as a single ZIP
file. 

See http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/proj/texslides for more information
on using PDFLaTeX and TrueType fonts for Powerpoint-free presentations.
